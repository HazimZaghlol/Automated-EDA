## Introduction

The Interactive Data Exploration Tool is designed to provide an easy and interactive way to load, explore, and visualize datasets stored in CSV and Excel files. This tool is built using Python's Pandas library for data manipulation, IPython widgets for interactivity, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

With this tool, you can quickly load data, view data types, display summary statistics, explore missing values, and visualize data distribution, all within an interactive Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Features

- Load data from CSV and Excel files.
- Display the head and tail of the loaded data.
- View data types of columns.
- Display summary statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, and more.
- Explore missing values in the dataset.
- Visualize data distribution using Matplotlib.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   
git clone https://github.com/HazimZaghlol/interactive-data-exploration.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install pandas ipywidgets matplotlib

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook environment:

jupyter notebook

4. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository and open the `Interactive_Data_Exploration.ipynb` notebook.

## Usage

1. Run the notebook cells to initialize the interactive widgets and code components.
2. Enter the file path of your dataset in the "Enter file path" input.
3. Click the "Load Data" button to load the data.
4. Once data is loaded, the other buttons will be enabled.
5. Click the relevant buttons to display data insights and visualizations.
